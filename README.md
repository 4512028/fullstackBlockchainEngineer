Section 1: Algorithms (10 pt)

Part A) Create a function in javascript / typescript that takes in a big number and converts it into the equivalent english text. Ex. If input was 1234, output must be One thousand, Two hundred, Thirty Four. Solutions must be valid up to 6 digits. Write unit tests to show that your function works.
Part B) Implement a binary search function and write code to run unit tests on the function.

Section 2: Single-Page-Application (15 pt)

Build a SPA to get and convert cryptocurrency exchange rates. You can use any open real-time API on the internet to fetch the rates. The Application will consist of three widgets. The first widget consists of:

1. A drop down menu for the user to select the crypto currency they wish to exchange from, also known as the base currency (Ex. Eth)
2. A text field for the user to input & read the numerical value of the crypto currency (ex. 2.45 Eth)
   The second widget will consist of:
3. A drop down menu for the user to select the crypto currency they wish to exchange to,
   also known as the quota currency (Ex. USDT)
4. A text field for the user to input and read the numerical value for the crypto currency
   The third widget will be a read only component to display the exchange rate of the base currency against the quota currency. Ex. 1 ETH = 1,718.53 USDT
   You are required to:
5. Build the SPA using React or React Native
6. Display the real-time exchange rates of the to and from currencies
7. Allow the user to input a value in the base currency text box
8. Allow users to input a value in the “to” text box
9. User input must be calculated in real-time, that is, the user does not need to click on
   “Enter’ to see the conversion rate.

Section 3: UI/UX Design and REST API (20 pt)
Part A) Implement the following figma ( https://www.figma.com/file/6RVhexj5M6uQiFovFRrHHL/Full-stack-Hiring-task?t=KYHqdUF3qJCNUJwZ-1 ) design using React. Marks will be awarded based on use
of reusable components, accuracy, attention to details and skills transforming design to code.
Note: You will have to sign up for figma to view design specifications such as color code and paddings.

Part B) Bring the search widget of your implementation to life.

1. Create a project using ASP.NET
2. Populate DB with the following venue types:
   a. Football Field
   b. Tennis Court
   c. Basketball Court
3. Populate DB with list of countries.
4. Create REST API to send the lists to the venue type field and location field respectively.
5. Use a reusable widget to display dates in the date field.
6. Users must be able to type a subphase into the venue field and see the possible options.
   Ex. if user types “ball” they should see options (a) and (b) appear. You must not implement this feature from scratch and find reusable components or libraries.
   Note: You are not required to implement the search functionality. Just the search field logic.
   Marks will be rewarded as follows:
7. Fulfillment of requirements
8. Structure and cleanliness of code
9. Field dynamics.
